- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m currently busy working in a Fintech company with a company git account and I am rarely using this account since then. You are welcome to reach me via email or add me in [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sophiehd) if there is any question with my code repositories or if there is any interesting project you'd like to work together.
